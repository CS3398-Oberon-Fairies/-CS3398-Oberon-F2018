# Priority Parking

is a web-based application that will be used by students, teachers, or just 
regular people to make parking less of a hassle. The app will show an 
interactive map of the campus parking lots and actively show which parking spots 
are open or taken. It will also give users the option to let it be known when 
they are leaving a certain parking spot, so others will know that a spot will 
be available soon.
